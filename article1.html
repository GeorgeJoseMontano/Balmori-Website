                            <h2>An enterprise solution gives your business a crucial "situational awareness"</h2>
                            
                            <h3>But successful implementation requires a certain down-to-earth, common-sense discipline</h3>

                            <hr>

                            <p>To have clear, accurate, instantaneous, real-time information about one's business - most businesspeople might almost kill for this capability.</br> </br>

                            Military organizations have a term for this desirable state of affairs: situational awareness.</br> </br>

                            The US Coast Guard defines situational awareness thus:</br> </br>

                            <em>Situational Awareness is the ability to identify, process, and comprehend the critical elements of information about what is happening to the team with regards to the mission. More simply, it's knowing what is going on around you.</em></br> </br>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <p>What is the practical value of situational awareness? For a business, just as much as for a military organization, situational awareness promotes superior team performance. "Superior team performance" means, concretely, increased probability of accomplishing the mission, whether it's hunting and killing a terrorist chieftain or meeting a quarterly sales target.</br> </br>

                                    Here's the US Coast Guard again:</br> </br>

                                    <em>Effective team situational awareness depends on team members developing accurate expectations for team performance by drawing on a common knowledge base.</em>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-sm-6" style="background:grey">
                                    <p></br> </br></br> </br>INSERT IMAGE</br> </br></br> </br></p>
                                    
                                </div>
                            </div>


                            </p>

                            <p>In the business world, there is a creature that provides this "common knowledge base." It's called ERP software ("Enterprise Resource Planning").</br> </br>

                            ERP, aka enterprise solutions, promise business owners a tantalizing vision of clarity and precise control of their business. ERPs purport to encompass all of an enterprise's data within one massive database.</br> </br>

                            Such a software solution, its proponents claim, gives all the various parts of a company a single source of truth. Cuts ambiguity. Gives clarity. Provides situational awareness.</br> </br>

                            It becomes a company's central nervous system. It promises a business organization vigor and precision of action.</br> </br>

                            ERP is real and has been around for some forty years at the Fortune 500 level. And in the Philippines' Top 100 companies. Oracle and SAP are examples most familiar to business people.</br> </br>

                            An enterprise solution promises to synchronize all company data and make them mutually consistent.</br> </br>

                            For example, sales people talk about their sales for the month; the software already shows how much of these sales are already collected and how much still remain accounts receivable.</br> </br>

                            Accounting can count on a correct output VAT computation resulting from these sales.</br> </br>

                            The inventory control people can see at once how much inventory depletion resulted from these sales. The purchasing people know exactly how much to order from suppliers in order to replenish stocks.</br> </br>

                            Sales people, purchasing people, inventory management people, credit and collections people, cashiers and accountants - all are able to approach their work with confidence that they are basing their actions on up-to-date data.</br> </br>

                            Thus all parts of the business are able to work faster without any degradation in accuracy. Without frequent pauses to double-check facts or rework mistakes.</br> </br>

                            Thus the entire company becomes more responsive, more nimble.</br> </br>

                            This is in stark contrast to the old management model - a model still much in use in Philippine SMEs today. In that model, individual departments maintain independent troves of data. Each department maintains its own island of information.</br> </br></p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-6"  style="background:grey">
                                    <p>INSERT IMAGE</br> </br>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <p>In that old model, without ERP, the very independence of departmental databases also makes inconsistency of data likely.</br> </br>

                                    For example, the sales department duly reports Invoice No. XX; but what if an accounting clerk fails to record the accounts receivable? The credit and collections department will then fail to collect a receivable it does not know about. This hurts cash flow - until someone notices and corrects the discrepancy.</br> </br></p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                                <p>Hiccups like these create a lot of small delays - delays that by themselves take a few minutes, but collectively slow down the entire organization... a lot.</br> </br>

                                That's because the different islands of information are not synchronized. They're often not consistent with one another. As a result, on some level, the different islands of information do not trust one another.</br> </br>

                                And that lack of trust shows up in the automatic double-checking of information coming from other departments. And that adds up to a slow-moving organization.</br> </br>

                                An enterprise solution promotes clarity, and thus confidence in the information. It removes uncertainty in day-to-day operations.</br> </br>

                                That's the theory; that's the ideal.</br> </br>

                                In recent years, ERP has trickled down to medium and small enterprises. But implementing it - and getting the full benefit of it - takes some sophistication on the part of the user organization.</br> </br>

                                ERP IN SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS. SMEs are more recent adopters of ERP software. And as late adopters, new users of ERP* software will at some point experience worrisome moments.</br> </br>

                                 Moments when the software refuses to accept certain data inputs. Moments when a report tells a tale that you "know" to be "untrue".</br> </br>

                                 At first, you suspect a flaw in the enterprise software. But it's not a bug; it's the software protecting you from making a mistake. It's called error-trapping, and it's your friend.</br> </br>

                                 Step back a minute and reflect on the fundamental business process.</br> </br>

                                In everyday life, there are things you need to do in a certain sequence - unless you want to simulate insanity. You put on your socks before you put on your shoes, for example.</br> </br>

                                 Same thing within ERP software.In day to day practice, you'll soon find that the ERP software won't let you input or post certain transactions until you first input and post a prerequisite transaction.</br> </br>

                                 Or until you first satisfy a prerequisite condition.</br> </br>

                                The ERP disallows premature or out-of-sequence data- encoding. And it'll be right to do so. It does this in order to preserve your audit trail - and the integrity of your database.</br> </br></p>
