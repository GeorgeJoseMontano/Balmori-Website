                                Six simple reasons that our competitors can’t cite:
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Really easy-to-use, heavy-duty solutions that let you focus on creating wealth, not on fixing computer problems.</li></br>

                                    <li>All our solutions are known for their solid audit trails. Audit trails are a sure sign of design refinement and expertise. This is what gives you peace of mind and lets you trust your data over many years of using an application.</li></br>

                                    <li>Low, low lifetime cost of ownership. Many of our customers have been using our solutions for ten 15, 20 years.</li></br>

                                    <li>More than 25 years of experience say you'll get effective solutions, not excuses, not disappearing acts.</li></br>

                                <li>The College of The Immaculate Conception in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija took delivery of our SURE! GL package in January 2003. One and a half days after delivery, they had produced two months financial statements.</li></br>


                                <li>It takes just two hours to train a user of our SURE! GL module, or any of our best-selling modules.</li></br>


                                <li>Read for yourself what our customers say about how easy to use our products are, in our Satisfied Customers page.</li></br>


                                <li>WalMart's worldwide purchasing affiliate, Pacific Resources Export Ltd., uses our SURE! GL in 27 mostly Third World cities on five continents. Guess why.</li>

                                In the first place, we're proud that most customers never need technical support. That says volumes about product robustness. And when you do need to call because of viruses or power fluctuations, we're proud of our prompt and effective technical support; we've developed our own computerized tech support knowledge base. And when we render technical support, you can count on dealing with a friendly human being, not a robot recording. Balmori extends technical support to all legal users by phone ((632) 890-1976 or 77) or e-mail <a href="mailto:balmori@balmorisoftware.com">balmori@balmorisoftware.com</a>. Our help desk is located in Makati City, Philippines. And yes, we also do house calls if required. Our farthest technical support trip ever was to the Republic of Kiribati, in Oceania. And oh, yes; you'll be pleased to know that our goal is to product-design our technical support department out of existence. Please visit our Technical Support page in www.balmorisoftware.com for more details.

                                For commodity items like rice, desktop PCs, gasoline, and laundry detergent, it's quite all right to base one's purchasing decisions on price. But though almost everything else in information technology has become commoditized, software hasn't. In the software business - especially in the software business - price is a supremely untrustworthy indicator of quality. It's quite possible to pay millions for junk, while an appropriate, effective solution for mere thousands might be right under one's nose.

                                In seeking software solutions for mission-critical applications, we maintain that it is absurd to make a buy/don't-buy decision, or even to make up a short list of potential vendors, on the basis of price alone. That's a myopic, potentially career-damaging approach. To help our prospects and customers make an informed decision when investing in software solutions, we release prices only after we have had a chance to present the product to a responsible officer of a prospective customer. That's a time investment of just one to two hours.

                                Once we've had a chance to demonstrate our product in action, then the prospective customer has a clear idea of its features, capabilities, performance, and limitations, if any. Only then can he make a responsible assessment of our - heck, of anyone's - offering. At that point we are quite happy to reveal the price, by way of a formal proposal. At that point, the prospective software buyer can assess price vs. performance. At that point, he can do himself justice.
